# Development of system for access to encyclopedic knowledge in natural language
This is the code for my Bachelor Thesis done at DNURT.

It is a question-answering system that allows to easily interact the Semantic Web using a natural language. The system uses DBPedia to obtain the necessary data in order to compose an answer.

It supports two input modes: using keyboard and using speech.

Currently, it supports only the Russian language, but can be easily extended to other languages using Google Translate API.
